# gamestack

This is a personal project to create a react MERN stack app which has a number of simple games. Currently has minesweeper.


Others:

- solitaire
- pacman
- frogger
- poker
- pool (?)
- pinball (?)


## Steps to creating Minesweeper:

1. <u>'const Grid'</u>: Create 5 x 5 grid
2. <u>'const generateInitialGrid'</u>: Give every cell a unique numerical id (in 5x5 from 1 - 25) displayed on each cell
3. <u>'const handleClick'</u>: Make every cell an event listener/clickable
4. <u>'const generateNewGrid'</u>: Make 3 random cells display 'X' instead of their numerical id (these will be the mines)
5. <u>'const updateAdjacentCells'</u>: Iterate through cell array again, check which # cell ids contain 'X's and attach an 'a' to cells that are X+1 or X-1 (e.g. if X is 15, then cells 14 and 16 will become 14a and 16a) these will be numerical 'proximity cells' 
   1. If cell is adjacent to two X/mines it will get two 'a's, i.e. 3 becomes 3aa
6. <u>'const updateAdjacentCells'</u>: For diagonal proximity cells
   1. Create diagonal relations between cells and modify cell id based on diagonal link
7. <u>'const handleClick'</u>: check which cells hold 'X's (mines) and switch the X to a ðŸ’£ if clicked
8. <u>'const nonBombCells'</u>: Create a constant that holds all cells minus the X/mine cells

12. h
13. h

## TO DO: 

[x] Grid
[x] Event listening
[x] Mines
[x] Proximity dynamic
[] Remove Xs
[x] Clicking a mine = game over
[] Remove id visibility, switch to single number
[] CSS styling (bomb cell red, button depressed)
[] 3 difficulties, or difficulty options:
- mimic actual game difficulty options 
- grid size
- mine number
